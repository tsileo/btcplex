# BTCplex

BTCplex is an open source [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/) block chain browser written in [Go](http://golang.org/), it allows you to search and navigate the [block chain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain). Also provides APIs to access data pragmatically.

**This is an early release, you might expect some bugs.**

## Requirements
- A [bitcoind](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/) instance (you can [build bitcoind in Disable-wallet mode](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#disable-wallet-mode))
- Go >=1.2
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) 2.6+
- [SSDB](https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb)
- [LevelDB](https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/)
- 150+GB disk space / 4+GB RAM

Building BTCplex database takes **1+ week** on a small server (dual core 1.2GHz/6GB RAM) and **28 hours** on a more powerful server (i5/16GB RAM).

## Installation
Assuming you have:
- a working Go workspace (and ``$GOPATH`` already set)
- [Redis 2.6+](http://redis.io/)
- [SSDB](https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb)
- [LevelDB](https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) ([nice tutorial](http://techoverflow.net/blog/2012/12/14/compiling-installing-leveldb-on-linux/))
- [Snappy](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/)

You will also need to export ``CGO_LDFLAGS``, needed to install [levigo](https://github.com/jmhodges/levigo).
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/tsileo/btcplex.git
$ cd btcplex
$ export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lsnappy"
$ ./build.sh
$ cp -r config.sample.json config.json
$ vim config.json
```

Start the initial import (the example use nohup, but you should use a tool like [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/)):

    $ nohup ./bin/btcplex-import > import.log&

And once the process is done, you will have to restart you bitcoind with the ``-blocknotify`` parameter: ``-blocknotify="/home/thomas/btcplex/bin/btcplex-blocknotify -c /home/thomas/btcplex/config.json %s"``. Now you can start ``btcplex-prod``:

    $ nohup ./bin/btcplex-prod > prod.log&

Even while importing, you can start the webserver:

    $ ./bin/btcplex-server


## Roadmap
- Stabilize everything for 1.0 release.
- Make sure a transaction can't be processed multiples times
- A receive payment API

Some features that are on my TODO list:

- An easy way to monitor Bitcoin address via API (maybe using Webhooks)
- Convert BTC to fiat money easily
- An official Python module to interact with the API and offer a reliable way to track address
- An official JS lib to interact with the API
- A Watch-only addresses page
- Display unconfirmed transactions on address page
- Live notification on a unconfirmed transaction page when it actually get included in a block
- Parse the coinbase to extract which pool mined the block
- An admin interface to monitor bitcoind/BTCplex
- New SSE endoind: utxin/utxout for a given address
- Escrow transaction handling
- Docker build
- Provides supervisord config
- ... (don't hesitate to request features!)
